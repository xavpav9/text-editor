# Text Editor

This is a basic text editor that I am working on.
It is made using pygame, pyperclip and sys in python. Requirements are in requirements.txt ( To install, run "pip install -r requirements.txt" )

### Supports so far:

- bold and italics - Ctrl-b, Ctrl-i
- text scaling - Ctrl-+, Ctrl--
- copy and paste - Ctrl-c, Ctrl-v
- save to file - Ctrl-s
