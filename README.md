# Text Editor

This is a basic text editor that I am working on.
I plan for it only to support basic writing, cursor movement and perhaps colours.
I will also add saving and loading to files, with perhaps a basic UI to handle file changing or take the input through sys.argv.
It is made using pygame in python. Requirements are in requirements.txt ( To install, run "pip install -r requirements.txt" ).

#### Supports:

- bold and italics - <C-b>, <C-i>
- text scaling - <C-+>, <C-->
- copy and paste - <C-c>, <C-v>
