# Text Editor

This is a basic text editor that I am working on.
It is made using pygame and pyperclip in python. Requirements are in requirements.txt ( To install, run "pip install -r requirements.txt" ).

#### Supports so far:

- bold and italics - <C-b>, <C-i>
- text scaling - <C-+>, <C-->
- copy and paste - <C-c>, <C-v>
- save to file - <C-s>
